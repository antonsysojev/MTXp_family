The goal is to find other articles that have done similar things to us. It is unlikely that someone has done something identical to us (persistence of mono-MTX) but it isn't impossible that others have done similar things (treatment response in RA familiality and stuff). Thus, we go for a hierarchical searching for articles. We start with heritability since it is an easier concept (not as many different formulations for this concept).

HERITABILITY
1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. HERITABILITY (herit*)
1.1.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 0 results.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. HERITABILITY (herit*)
1.1.2. METHOTREXATE (methotrexate[MeSH TERMS)
-> 2 results.
-> None are relevant here.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. HERITABILITY (herit*)
1.1.3. TREATMENT (treatm*)
-> 18 results.
-> One estimate of heritability of TNFi using GWAS data.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.2. FAMILY OR TWIN (famil* OR twin*)
1.2.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 9 results.
-> None are relevant here.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.2. FAMILY OR TWIN (famil* OR twin*)
1.2.2. METHOTREXATE (methotrexate[MeSH TERMS)
-> 73 hits.
-> None were relevant here.

	1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
	1.2. FAMILY OR TWIN (famil* OR twin*)
	1.2.3. TREATMENT (treatm*)
	-> 741 hits.
	-> This is too much, we need to slim it down?

2. NOT IN RA
2.1. HERITABILITY (herit*)
2.1.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 2 results.
-> None are relevant here.

2. NOT IN RA
2.1. HERITABILITY (herit*)
2.1.2. METHOTREXATE (methotrexate[MeSH TERMS)
-> 17 results.
-> None are relevant here.

2. NOT IN RA
2.2. FAMILY OR TWIN (famil* OR twin*)
2.2.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 18 results.
-> None are relevant here.

-> CONCLUSION: There doesn't seem to have been any previous study that looked into the heritability of treatment response within RA nor of MTX treatment response in general.

FAMILIAL AGGREGATION / FAMILIAL RISKS / FAMILIALITY
1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. FAMILIAL/FAMILIAR (familial* OR familiar*)
1.1.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 2 results.
-> One is Thomas' study, the other is not relevant here.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. FAMILIAL/FAMILIAR (familial* OR familiar*)
1.1.2. METHOTREXATE (methotrexate[MeSH TERMS])

-> None are relevant.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.1. FAMILIAL/FAMILIAR (familial* OR familiar*)
1.1.3. TREATMENT (treatm*)

-> None were really relevant.

1. IN RA (arthritis, rheumatoid[MeSH TERMS])
1.2. FAMILY HISTORY (famil* AND histor*)
1.2.1. MONO-MTX ((methotrexate OR MTX) AND (monotherapy OR mono-therapy OR mono))
-> 1 result.
